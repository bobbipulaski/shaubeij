Rather than simply offering an inventory of concurrency APIs and mechanisms, it provides design rules, patterns, and mental models that make it easier to build concurrent programs that are both correct and performant. He specializes in synchronization and concurrency and was a member of the JSR-166 expert group that developed the new concurrency utilities.

Rather than learn the intricacies of concurrency, why not switch to a functional language that provides first class support for immutability. 
Java SE 5 and 6 are a huge step forward for the development of concurrent applications, with improvements to the Java Virtual Machine to support high-performance, highly scalable concurrent classes and a rich set of new concurrency building blocks.

Are there any substantial resources for learning concurrency in java that dont abstract away a lot of how it works. Hi! I'm diving deep into learning python.
